Install & Setup Basic JupyterHub
================================

Here we setup a basic JupyterHub installation. At the end of this section
you'll have a running (but nonfunctional) JupyterHub server. Further sections
will complete the install by integrating it with your cluster.

.. contents:: :local:

Create a user for running JupyterHub
------------------------------------

Before installing anything, you'll need to create the user account that will be
used to run JupyterHub. Here we'll use ``jupyterhub``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ adduser jupyterhub


Create directories to store JupyterHub Installation
---------------------------------------------------

A JupyterHub installation has three types of files which will need their own
directories created before installation:

- Software files. This includes a Python environment and all required
  libraries. Here we use ``/opt/jupyterhub``.
- Configuration files. Here we use ``/etc/jupyterhub``.
- Runtime files. By default this includes a sqlite database (can be configured
  to use other databases). Here we use ``/var/jupyterhub``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Software files
    $ mkdir -p /opt/jupyterhub

    # Configuration files
    $ mkdir /etc/jupyterhub

    # Runtime files
    $ mkdir /var/jupyterhub
    $ chown jupyterhub /var/jupyterhub


Install a private python environment
------------------------------------

To avoid interactions between the system python installation and JupyterHub,
we'll install a full Python environment into the software directory. The
easiest way to do this is to use miniconda_, but this isn't a strict
requirement.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -o /tmp/miniconda.sh
    $ bash /tmp/miniconda.sh -b -p /opt/jupyterhub/miniconda
    $ rm /tmp/miniconda.sh

We also recommend adding miniconda to the ``root`` user's path to ease further
commands.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo 'export PATH="/opt/jupyterhub/miniconda/bin:$PATH"' >> /root/.bashrc
    $ source /root/.bashrc


Install JupyterHub
------------------

Now we can install JupyterHub and its dependencies. Since JupyterHub has many
configuration options, we'll only install the basic ``jupyterhub`` application
for now - further steps will add more packages later on.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterhub -y


Configure JupyterHub
--------------------

Now we're ready to configure our basic JupyterHub installation and get things
running to see if everything works. JupyterHub configuration is written as a
Python file (typically ``/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py``). Here we'll
configure only a few fields:

- ``JupyterHub.bind_url``: the public facing URL of the whole JupyterHub
  application.

- ``JupyterHub.db_url``: the address that the JupyterHub database can be
  reached at. JupyterHub supports many databases - for now we'll use sqlite.
  For information on using a different database see `the JupyterHub docs
  <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/database.html>`__.

- ``JupyterHub.cookie_secret_file``: the location to store the cookie secret.
  There are other options for setting the cookie secret, but saving a secret
  token to a file in a secure location is a good default option. See `the
  JupyterHub docs
  <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started/security-basics.html#cookie-secret>`__
  for more information.


Create the cookie secret file and change permissions so only the ``jupyterhub``
user has access.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ openssl rand -hex 32 > /etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_cookie_secret
    $ chmod 600 /etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_cookie_secret
    $ chown jupyterhub /etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_cookie_secret


Save the following configuration to ``/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    c.JupyterHub.bind_url = 'http://:<PORT-TO-USE>'
    c.JupyterHub.cookie_secret_file = '/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_cookie_secret'
    c.JupyterHub.db_url = 'sqlite:////var/jupyterhub/jupyterhub.sqlite'


Open JupyterHub Port
--------------------

For users to access JupyterHub, they'll need access to the port set in
``JupyterHub.bind_url`` above. How to open this port is system specific and is
left as an exercise for the reader.


Start JupyterHub and check that it's accessible
-----------------------------------------------

At this point you should be able to start JupyterHub as the ``jupyterhub`` user
using your created configuration file. The JupyterHub process will be a long
running process - how you intend to manage it (``supervisord``, etc...) is
system specific. The requirements are:

- Start with ``jupyterhub`` as the user
- Start with ``/var/jupyterhub`` as the working directory
- Add ``/opt/jupyterhub/miniconda/bin`` to path
- Specify the configuration file location with ``-f /etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py``

For ease, we recommend creating a small bash script stored at
``/opt/jupyterhub/start-jupyterhub`` to set this up:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    export PATH="/opt/jupyterhub/miniconda/bin:$PATH"
    cd /var/jupyterhub
    jupyterhub -f /etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py


For *testing* here's how you might start JupyterHub manually:


.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /var/jupyterhub
    $ sudo -iu jupyterhub /opt/jupyterhub/start-jupyterhub

Things won't work yet (more configuration is still needed), but you should at
least have access to a web page.

.. image:: /_images/login-page-hello-world.png
    :width: 90 %
    :align: center
    :alt: JupyterHub "Hello World" login page

In the next section we'll configure spawners and authentication to get things
fully working.
