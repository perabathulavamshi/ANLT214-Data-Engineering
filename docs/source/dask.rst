Integration with Dask
=====================

Dask_ is a powerful and flexible tool for scaling Python analytics across a
cluster. Dask works out-of-the-box with JupyterHub, but there are several
things you can configure to make the experience nicer.


Install Dependencies
--------------------

To run Dask on Hadoop you'll need to install `dask-yarn`_ in the :ref:`notebook
environment <notebook-environments>`.

.. code-block:: shell

    # Install with conda
    $ conda install -c conda-forge dask-yarn

    # Or install with pip
    $ pip install dask-yarn


Install Optional Dependencies
-----------------------------

For a nicer UI experience and access to the `Dask Dashboard`_, you'll also want
to install `jupyter-server-proxy`_ and ipywidgets_ in the :ref:`notebook
environment <notebook-environments>`.

.. code-block:: shell

    # Install with conda
    $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-server-proxy ipywidgets

    #  Or install with pip
    $ pip install jupyter-server-proxy ipywidgets


Configuration
-------------

While Dask will work as long as ``dask-yarn`` is installed, as an administrator
you can preconfigure a few default fields to make things easier for your users.

Dask's default configuration is collected from the following locations (earlier
sources taking precedence):

- Environment variables like ``DASK_YARN__ENVIRONMENT``
- YAML files found in ``$DASK_CONFIG`` (defaults to ``~/.config/dask/``)
- YAML files found in ``<ENV>/etc/dask`` where ``<ENV>`` is a user's
  Conda/Virtual environment
- YAML files found in the system ``/etc/dask/`` directory
- Default settings within the various dask libraries

As such, you have a few options for how to pass configuration on to your users.
If you're using :ref:`archived notebook environments <archived-environments>`,
a good option is to put configuration in ``<ENV>/etc/dask/config.yaml`` (where
``<ENV>`` is the top-directory of the environment). This allows having
different configuration settings for different environemnts. These can also be
combined with environment variables set via ``YarnSpawner.environment`` (useful
for things determined at runtime, or overrides for the static config files).

Below we provide an example configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    yarn:
      # Specify the default Python environment to use for the workers.
      # In most cases this should be the same as the environment used for the
      # user's notebook server.
      # Here we use an archived environment stored on hdfs
      environment: hdfs:///jupyterhub/example.tar.gz',

      # To instead specify an environment already on every node, use
      # environment: local:///path/to/environment

      # The YARN queue to submit applications to by default
      queue: dask

      # Configure the default worker vcores and memory
      # These can be overridden by the user as needed
      worker:
        vcores: 2
        memory: 2 GiB

      # Use `local` deploy mode. This runs the scheduler in the same container
      # as the notebook, and allows for viewing the dashboard using
      # jupyter-server-proxy.
      deploy-mode: local

    distributed:
      dashboard:
        # Configure the link template for the dask dashboard. This updates the
        # dashboard links to proxy through jupyter-server-proxy
        link: /user/{JUPYTERHUB_USER}/proxy/{port}/status

The above are likely parameters you'll want to set, but Dask has many more
configuration options. For more information see the `Dask configuration
documentation`_.


Usage
-----

Given a fully configured system, users should be able to create a Dask Cluster
as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import dask_yarn
    cluster = dask_yarn.YarnCluster()


Default parameters can be overridden by specifying them at runtime:

.. code-block:: python

    import dask_yarn
    # Use different worker resources than the default
    cluster = dask_yarn.YarnCluster(
        worker_vcores=4,
        worker_memory='4 GiB'
    )

Users can then connect to their cluster and start doing work:

.. code-block:: python

    from dask.distributed import Client
    client = Client(cluster)

    # Start doing computations
    import dask.dataframe as dd
    ddf = dd.read_parquet("hdfs:///path/to/my/data.parquet")

Clusters can be scaled dynamically at runtime:

.. code-block:: python

    # Scale up to 10 workers
    cluster.scale(10)

    # Scale down to 4 workers
    cluster.scale(4)

If you installed ``jupyter-server-proxy`` and ``ipywidgets`` you'll also get a
nice UI for interacting with the cluster:

.. image:: /_images/dask-usage.gif
    :width: 90 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Interactive usage of Dask

Clusters can be shutdown manually, or will be automatically shutdown on
notebook exit.
